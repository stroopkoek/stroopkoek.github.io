LXC is a wonderful technique and I use it for multiple reasons. One, they're lightweight. Two, they're as easy as virtual machines, maybe even easier.

BUT, I found out that the Proxmox VE implementation of LXC containers has an annoying bug. Let's see what I mean...


See above: no connection to google.com or even the gateway!

A quick look is to check with the following command, on Debian it is: `ip addr` 

The adapter is confirmed down. So no issue with DNS.


Let's fix this. Head on over to the network page from your container; edit your adapter. Mine is net0.

CTRL + A, or whatever you Apple users use, and delete the current MAC address.

Click OK. What will happen is that the adapter will reinitialize and give you a new MAC address. You will also notice that you have a network connection again, weird...

And tada, it works again! Running the `ip addr` again gives a new status UP. So this is my hotfix for suddenly not having an connection with your LXC container. I have this issue sometimes when rebooting the entire node or even when I reboot the LXC container itself.
